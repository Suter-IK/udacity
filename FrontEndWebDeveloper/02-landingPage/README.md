# Landing Page Project

## Description
The project is an exercise for udacity nanodegree "Web Front End Developer". 
Given some static html and css, I had to convert it to a interactive navigation page using eventListeners, 
various DOM elements and some css styling.

## Instructions
The starter project has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Landing Page project. You'll need to convert this project from a static project to an interactive one. This will require modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.

To get started, open `js/app.js` and start building out the app's functionality

For specific, detailed instructions, look at the project instructions in the Udacity Classroom.

## Development
I started with the styling of the static navigation controls by just adding ul and li elements to the html.
After having made it fully responsive, I continued with the javascript part. 
Reading all sections into an array first before building the navigation controls (getListElements) made it easier to 
debug the output with console.log.
Two event handlers are used here: One for clicking the nav control and the other for scrolling. 
Both events have an effect on the style of the nav controls which change the color at active state. 
Also the active section is dynamically decorated with bubbles.

Although this was not part of this exercise, I tried to document the project with js.doc. 
Proposal for better documentation would be appreciated.

## Contribute
If anyone wants to improve my js.doc syntax, feel free.
